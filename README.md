# DH150-SebastienDills-A7
My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon design features of several clothing re-sale apps and websites, notably Depop and Etsy. The design is meant to be minimalist and transparent. It provides reccomendations each time an item is bought or sold on pricing, it analyzes the quality and authenticity of products, forces sellers to be descriptive (including dates, brands and categories), and provides a map to help sellers and buyers connect locally. 

This high-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

1) List items with an in-app camera in order to maintain authenticity

2) Search and categorize items via brand, year etc (uphold high standards with authentication process and 3rd party categorization)

3) Have price ranking system to show what percent value you are getting at a certain price

The user persona could be literally anyone but I've chosen to stick with a college age female. This is the demographic I've interviewed for each step of the process up to this point so it makes sense to do things this way. In addition this is a demographic that I think highly represents my app/company values.

I generally stuck to grew, black and white with a bit of red and navy. I mainly focused on making sure everything was clearly legible, as simple as possible and asethetically pleasing. Here are the links to the color contract and the changes I made.

Images and Icons - I used quiet a few emojis both because the silhouettes would very recognizable to user. In addition to this is was easy to implement with apple software. Putting things in consistent locations was also important. For exampple having the filters in the top right corner is pretty standard so that was an easy choice. The three lines is also a standard convention to indicate filters or an additional
