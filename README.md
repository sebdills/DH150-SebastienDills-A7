# DH150-SebastienDills-A7
My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon design features of several clothing re-sale apps and websites, notably Depop and Etsy. The design is meant to be minimalist and transparent. It provides reccomendations each time an item is bought or sold on pricing, it analyzes the quality and authenticity of products, forces sellers to be descriptive (including dates, brands and categories), and provides a map to help sellers and buyers connect locally. 

#### This high-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

1) List items with an in-app camera in order to maintain authenticity

2) Search and categorize items via brand, year etc (uphold high standards with authentication process and 3rd party categorization)

3) Have price ranking system to show what percent value you are getting at a certain price

The user persona could be literally anyone but I've chosen to stick with a college age female. This is the demographic I've interviewed for each step of the process up to this point so it makes sense to do things this way. In addition this is a demographic that I think highly represents my app/company values.

#### Summary of findings from test: 

The main takeaway was making sure everything is accessible from everywhere. For example I want there to be multiple points of exit from every screen on the wireframe. Basically everything should be accessible from everywhere without casuing confusiton or cluttering the screen. I found several points on the wireflow that didn't work as intended and made it so the user was "stuck". This was very helpful as it allowed me to find many more methods of navigating through the app. In the future I want to add as many functions as possible. Due to the time constraint I didn't add everything I could have this week but going forward I'm going to make sure the wireframe/flow feels as much like a real app/website as possible. 

#### Explaination regarding design: 

Colors - I choose to use very little color in my design, the color contrast plugin I was using in Figma seemed to dislike my use of colors which was a factor in why I made my choice. I generally stuck to grew, black and white with a bit of red and navy. I mainly focused on making sure everything was clearly legible, as simple as possible and asethetically pleasing. Here are the links to the color contract and the changes I made. Going into next week I'm going to choose a more sophisticated color palate in order to make the app more visually pleasing.

Images and Icons - I used quiet a few emojis both because the silhouettes would very recognizable to user. In addition to this is was easy to implement with apple software. Putting things in consistent locations was also important. For exampple having the filters in the top right corner is pretty standard so that was an easy choice. The three lines is also a standard convention to indicate filters or an additional dropdown tab. I think making things recognizable and simple in this case is the most efficent method. 

Word Choice - I used as little words as possible, only using long lines of text when I felt like it would ass clarity or otherwise wouldn't take away from the exprience. The only time I really typed anything out (excluding what would be user generated text) was on the user profile page. I choose to do it this way because the page was otherwise empty and adding text didn't take away from anything and in fact make the screen feel more full.

#### Cognitive Walkthrough

The main findings I had from this exersize were that I was successful in making my website reminisent and stylistically similar to other. This allowed the user to navigate the site efficiently even without explicit documentation. This was a conscious choice I made so I was happy it paid off. The main issue I found was that the user was frusterated by the lack of freedom within the app. I didn't take the time to add wireframes for every single possible combinations of events and instead focused on all the basic design features. I can see how the user was frusterated by this as it made the experience feel less app-like. 

#### Reflection

My first and the most important step in the process was the design of the wireframe. I am happy with how it turned out it took me many hours to get everything working the way I wanted to and to figure out how Figma works. While I am proud of my design and the functionality of it I would still make a few design changes in hindsite. For example the sample screen I choose to use was from an iPhone with a non rectangular screen. Because of this what I designed was not optimum for the screen shape, but by the time I realized this I would have needed to re-do the whole project, making it not worth my time. That was a point of frustration, but other than that nothing stands out as warranting major change. I was wish I knew more about Figma as a flatform so I could more easily copy and modify slides. At the begining I was starting with each slide as a blank slate instead of working off older ones. Just having more familiarity with Figma would've made the process so much easier. Based on the prototype testing I would add more colors and clean up the deisgn a little. I am confident in the design in the sense that anyone could navigate it, but both of my users said that the wish the design was a bit more visually appealing.
